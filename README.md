"# MergeArrays" 

the general interview question is : given two sorted int [] arrays in c#, with mutually exclusive members, show how you would merge the two in a function with the following description:


int[] GetSortedMergedArray(int[] a1, int[] a2)


My console app illustration has this as a static method.

Here is a sample output, release build:
C:\Users\Brian\source\repos\MergeArrays\MergeArrays\bin\Release>MergeArrays.exe
Exiting on value 32710504 in ar1, with 16,354,725 elements.
ar2 is populated with 15,662,901 elements.
Time taken to set up two int arrays: 24 Seconds 3 Milliseconds
Time taken to merge these two into an array of 32,017,626 elements: 1 Seconds 3 Milliseconds
